# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

In this Dashboard, I used Power BI visualization software and for the database, I used the MS-Sql server.

## In this learning, I take the pizza sales dataset from the Kaggle and after some data cleaning & transformation. I created a dashboard that answers some questions like - 
1) What is the total Revenue?
2) What is the Total Number of orders?
3) How many pizzas sold? 
4) What are the best and worst-selling pizzas?
5) What's our average order value?
6) Which are the Top and Bottom 5 best-selling pizzas?
7) Which are the Top and Bottom 5 Worst selling pizzas?
8) In Which Month Pizza Sales are the highest?
9) Which pizza category sales are the highest?
10) Which size of pizza Sold most?
